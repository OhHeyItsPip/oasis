# Oasis

What WAS Oasis?!?!

Oasis WAS a rehost of closedverse, with a much better mod team, nicer CSS, and, a better mod team? I always wanted to add new features, but I never got around to it, mostly because I was busy working on getting Indigo ready for launch.

Closedverse has a github too! Which makes this, really, really redundant! https://github.com/ariankordi/closedverse

It's a standard Django app.

Make the config, migrate, then either `runserver` or run it in uWSGI.
