# Oasis

What WAS Oasis?!?!

Oasis WAS a rehost of closedverse, with a much better mod team, nicer CSS, and, a better mod team? I always wanted to add new features, but I never got around to it, mostly because I was busy working on getting Indigo ready for launch.

Closedverse has a github too! Which makes this, really, really redundant! https://github.com/ariankordi/closedverse

only reason this is up is so I can add a license that ensures no one tries using Oasis' name. please stop, its been 2 years.

It's a standard Django app.

Make the config, migrate, then either `runserver` or run it in uWSGI.

I added the Mozilla Public License, so this code can be used but you cannot use the likeness such as the Oasis name.
